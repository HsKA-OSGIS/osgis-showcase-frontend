# Fonts

This folder contains the webfonts for the used in the templates. Due to license questions, these fonts cannot be
included with the sourcecode. Your default sans-serif font will be used instead.
If you'd like to use your own font, simply place the appropriate font files (several formats for different browsers
needed) here.

Filenames:
font.eot
font.woff
font.ttf
font.svg
